# Driving School
This is a small app that displays data relating to videos of driving lessons.
On smaller screens the 4 columns on the right remain visible while the other are horizontally scrollable,
as these columns have important or actionable content.
Data and bitrate have tooltips with more detailed info and the clipboard icon copies id to the clipboard.
The rows in the table are lazy loaded from the endpoint as the user scrolls to the bottom

### Technologies used
The app uses a simple backend endpoint using node.js that serves the drive lesson data. 
On the frontend the app uses Typescript, React, MUI
